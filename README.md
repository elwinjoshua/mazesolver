Mazesolver creates a blank window gui using the built-in python module tkinter and begins drawing cells in a row-column fashion. Once the results of the maze is printed, it implements the depth-first search algorithm alongside the draw function and draws a line into its chosen path. The function will backtrack with a different line to show you how it behaves under these conditions.
